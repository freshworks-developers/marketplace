## Shipped vs contributor specs

| Artifact | Shipped to IDE? | Path |
|----------|-----------------|------|
| Slim controller (Tier 1) | **Yes** — always loaded | `installer/src/specs/fw-dev-tools-spec.md` |
| Orchestration brain (Tier 2) | **Yes** — always loaded | `specs/agent-behaviour.md` (synced to `installer/src/specs/` on install) |
| Ecosystem map | **Yes** — via `~/.fw-dev-tools/specs/` | `specs/ecosystem-map.md` |
| `AGENTS.md` (repo root) | **No** — contributor routing inventory only | Never installed to end-user IDE paths |

End developers receive specs through `npx @freshworks/fw-dev-tools install` (Cursor rules, Claude `CLAUDE.md`, Codex `AGENTS.md`, and `~/.fw-dev-tools/specs/`).

## How to Contribute

When you add, remove, or rename files under any skill’s **`rules/`** or **`commands/`**, update the **Rules and slash commands (inventory)** section in **[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)** so Cursor / Claude **`rulesPath`** / **`commandsPath`** in **`com.cursor/marketplace.json`** and **`io.anthropic.claude-code/marketplace.json`** stay aligned with what ships.

**FDK / Node version truth** should match **`docs/engine-matrix.md`** whenever you change toolchain guidance in **`skills/fw-setup/SKILL.md`**.

### Reporting Bugs

Use **[ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md)** at the repo root: the **mandatory issue body template** and checklists there are required for GitHub issues (see that file for details).

Before submitting:
1. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/freshworks-developers/fw-dev-tools/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. Use the latest version of the skills

When reporting bugs, include:
- **Clear title** describing the issue
- **Steps to reproduce** the problem
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Environment details** (Cursor version, Claude Code / Codex if relevant, FDK version, Node.js version)
- **Error messages** or validation output if applicable
Beyond the mandatory template, a good report still has a **clear title**, **steps to reproduce**, and **expected vs actual** behavior.

### Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Please include:
- **Use case**: Why is this feature needed?
- **Proposed solution**: How should it work?
- **Alternatives considered**: Other approaches you've thought about

### Submitting Changes

We accept contributions for:
- Bug fixes
- New commands
- Documentation improvements
- New reference files
- Rule enhancements
- Template additions

## Development Guidelines

### Security and publish telemetry

See **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** for vulnerability reporting and for disclosure that `.meta.json` skill metrics are included in marketplace publish zips by design (platform ingestion; local file deleted after successful publish).

### Skill Structure

Each skill follows the Agent Skills Specification. In **this repo**, editor rules live under **`skills/<name>/rules/`** (not nested under **`skills/<name>/.cursor/rules`**). The Cursor skill bundle uses **`com.cursor/skills-metadata.json`** with per-skill **`rulesDirectory`** / **`commandsDirectory`** pointing at **`./rules`** and **`./commands`** beside **`SKILL.md`**.

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                 # Required: Main skill file with YAML frontmatter
├── README.md                # User-facing documentation
├── commands/                # Optional: Slash commands (/fdk-fix, /fdk-migrate, …)
│   └── command.md           # One file per command
├── rules/                   # Optional: Cursor rules (.mdc) or fw-review audit rules (.md)
│   └── rule-name.mdc

```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what the skill does and when to use it
compatibility: Platform versions, FDK versions, Node versions
---

# Skill Title

Instructions and content for the AI assistant...
```

### Rule Files (.mdc)

Cursor rules use `.mdc` format with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: rule-name              # Must match filename (without .mdc)
description: What this rule covers
globs: ["**/pattern/*.js"]   # Optional: Auto-trigger on file patterns
alwaysApply: true            # true = always loaded, false = on-demand
---

# Rule Content

Detailed instructions, patterns, and examples...
```

**Naming convention**: The `name` field must match the filename:
- File: `my-rule.mdc` → `name: my-rule`

### Commands

Commands are markdown files in `commands/` directory:

```markdown
# Command Name

Brief description of what the command does.

## Step 1: First Step

Instructions...

## Step 2: Second Step

Instructions...
```

**Command naming**:
- Filename becomes the command: `migrate.md` → `/migrate`
- Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word commands

### References

Reference files provide detailed documentation loaded on-demand:

```
references/
├── api/                    # API documentation
│   ├── request-method-docs.md
│   └── oauth-docs.md
├── errors/                 # Error handling guides
│   ├── manifest-errors.md
│   └── oauth-errors.md
├── architecture/           # Platform architecture docs
└── tests/                  # Test patterns (refusal / violations)
    ├── refusal.json
    └── violations.json
```

## Testing Your Changes

See **[tests/TESTING.md](tests/TESTING.md)** for the full test suite guide — especially **When to run which layer** (change-type → required layers). Summary:

### Layer 1 — Installer tests (required when `installer/` changes, runs in CI)

```bash
cd installer && npm install && npm test
```

Install/update/uninstall lifecycle, MCP merge, meta scripts, and IDE-specific installers.

### Layer 2 + 3 — Static + regex evals (required, runs in CI)

```bash
cd tests && npm install && npm test
```

215 static/parser assertions plus 141 regex eval scenarios across all skill files — no LLM, no API key. Must pass before opening a PR.

### Layer 4 — LLM behavioral evals (required for skill edits, local only)

```bash
cd tests && npm run eval
```

Or via the unified runner:

```bash
bash tests/run-all-tests.sh --llm-eval
```

Requires `claude` or `cursor` on PATH (subscription auth — no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` needed). Or, in **Claude Code or Cursor**, ask: *"Run the skill evals"*.

**Attach `tests/all-tests-report.html` to your PR.** Required for any PR that modifies a `SKILL.md`, command file, or `.meta.template.json`. Maintainers may also trigger **[CI](https://github.com/freshworks-developers/fw-dev-tools/actions/workflows/ci.yml)** with **Run skill evals** checked (`workflow_dispatch`) for on-demand reports — supplemental to local runs, not a PR gate.

### PR checklist

Every PR should satisfy the checklist in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (auto-populated when you open a PR on GitHub):

- [ ] `cd tests && npm test` passes locally (no LLM)
- [ ] For skill edits: existing eval scenarios reviewed and updated if needed, new scenarios added for new behavioral rules, evals run and passing
- [ ] `tests/all-tests-report.html` attached to the PR

### Writing new static tests — cross-platform rules

The CI workflow runs on Linux; contributors may be on macOS or Windows. Any new test added to `skill-static.test.js` must follow these rules:

- **Use `grepFiles()`** — the pure-Node helper already in the file — instead of shell `grep`. BSD `grep` (macOS) lacks `--exclude-dir`; Windows has no `grep` at all.
- **Guard bash invocations** with `{ skip: process.platform === 'win32' }` if a test runs a `.sh` script.
- **No Unix-only CLI flags** (`find -exec`, `chmod`, etc.) — use `node:fs` APIs.
- **Paths via `join()`** — never string-concatenate with `/`.

### 0. Docs hygiene (optional, recommended)

```bash
python3 scripts/check-internal-links.py
bash scripts/check-marketplace-versions.sh
```

### Smoke-test in Cursor / Claude Code / Codex (optional)

Run the installer against your branch and verify the skills load in your IDE:

```bash
npx @freshworks/fw-dev-tools install
```

Then type `/fw-setup-` in chat — autocomplete should list available commands. For **fw-publish**, confirm MCP is configured per **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)**.

### Validate Rule Files

For rule files, verify:
- `name` field matches filename
- `alwaysApply` is set correctly
- `globs` patterns are valid (if used)

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your changes are complete** and tested locally
2. **Update documentation** if you're changing behavior (**AGENTS.md** skill inventory if **rules/** or **commands/** changed; **docs/engine-matrix.md** if toolchain pins changed)
3. **Run docs hygiene** (`check-internal-links.py`, **`check-marketplace-versions.sh`**) if you touched umbrella plugin JSON (`com.cursor/`, `io.anthropic.claude-code/`, `com.openai.codex/`, `.agents/plugins/`) or docs with many links
4. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Description of what and why
   - Link to related issues (if any)
   - Screenshots or examples (if applicable)

5. **Address review feedback** promptly
6. **Squash commits** if requested before merge

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commit style:
- `feat: add new /lint command`
- `fix: correct OAuth template structure`
- `docs: update README with examples`
- `refactor: simplify validation workflow`

## Style Guidelines

### Markdown

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags
- Keep lines under 120 characters when possible
- Use consistent list formatting (either `*` or `-`, not both)

### Code Examples

- Always include language tags in code blocks
- Use Platform 3.0 patterns only (no legacy 2.x code)
- Include comments for complex logic
- Show both correct and incorrect examples where helpful:
  ```javascript
  // ❌ WRONG
  $request.post(url, options);

  // ✅ CORRECT
  $request.invokeTemplate('templateName', { context, body });
  ```

### JSON

- Use 2-space indentation
- No trailing commas
- Keys in logical order (platform-version, modules, engines)

### Rule Content

- Start with clear "When to use" guidance
- Use tables for quick reference
- Include concrete examples
- Mark blocking vs non-blocking issues clearly

## Security

When contributing examples or documentation:
- **Never include real API keys, tokens, or secrets**
- Use placeholders like `<%= iparam.api_key %>` or `your-api-key-here`
- Use generic domains like `your-domain.freshdesk.com`
- Mark sensitive iparams with `"secure": true` in examples
